    """Apply a sequence of regex substitutions to a text field in each AudioTask.

    Rules are loaded from a YAML file containing a list of dicts with
    ``pattern`` and ``repl`` keys (and an optional ``count`` key).

    Reads from ``text_key`` (default ``"pred_text"``), applies all rules,
    and writes the result to ``output_text_key`` (default ``"cleaned_text"``).
    The original ``text_key`` field is preserved unchanged.

    After all substitutions, ``_skipme`` is set to ``"Empty after regex cleaning"``
    ONLY when the regex actually removed content: the prediction was non-empty before
    cleaning, became empty after, and ``_skipme`` was still empty. A prediction that was
    already empty before cleaning is left untouched (``_skipme`` is NOT set) — nothing was
    cleaned away, so it is not a regex-cleaning skip.
